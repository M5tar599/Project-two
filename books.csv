The Egg - short story,"       You were on your way home, when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable. But fatal, none the less. It was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you... but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered, you were better off. Trust me. And that's when you met me. What happened? Where am I? You died. I said, matter of factly. No point in mincing words. There was... there was a truck. And it was skidding. Yes. I... I died? Yes. But don't feel bad about it. Everyone dies. You looked around. There was... nothingness. Just you, and me. What is this place? Is this, the afterlife? More or less. Are you... God? Yes. I'm God. My kids... My wife... What about them? Will they be alright? That's what I like to see, I said. You just died, and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff right there. You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man, or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure maybe. Don't worry, I said. They'll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you. Your wife will cry on the outside. But will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation, she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved. Oh... So what happens now? Do I go to Heaven? Or Hell or something? Neither. You'll be reincarnated. Ah... So the Hindus were right! All religions are right in their own way. Walk with me. You followed along as we strolled through the void."," Where are we going? No where in particular. It's just nice to walk while we talk. So, what's the point then? When I get reborn, I'll just be a blank slate right? A baby? So, all my experiences and everything... everything I did in this life... Won't matter... Not so. You have within you, all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.
You just don't remember them right now. I stopped walking, and took you by the shoulders. Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water. To see if it's hot or cold.
You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you've gained all the experiences it had. You've been in a human for the last 48 years. So you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you'd start remembering everything.
But there's not point to doing that between each life. How many times have I been reincarnated then? Oh, lots! Lots and lots! And into lots of different lives. This time around, you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D. Wait... what?! You're sending me back in time? Well I guess technically. Time as you know it, only exists in your universe.
Things are different where I come from. Where... where you come from? Oh sure, I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me."," I know you'll want to know what it's like there but honestly you wouldn't understand. Oh... You said, a little let down. But wait... If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point. Sure, happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespans, you don't even know it's happening. So... what's the point of it all? I looked you in the eye. The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature. You mean... mankind? You want to us to mature? No, just you.
I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature, and become a larger and greater intellect. Just me? What about everyone else? There is no one else. In this universe, there's just you and me. You stared blankly at me. But all the people on Earth... All you. Different incarnations of you.
Wait... I'm... everyone? Now you're getting it. I'm every human being who ever lived? Or who will ever live, yes. I'm Abraham Lincoln? And you're John Wilkes Booth too. I'm Hitler?! You said appalled. And you're the millions he killed. I'm Jesus?! And you're everyone who followed Him.
You fell silent. Every time you victimized someone, you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you have done, you have done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was or will be experienced by you. You thought for a long time. Why? Why do all this? Because someday you will become like me.
","Because that's what you are! You're one of my kind. You're my child! Wow!! You said incredulous. You mean I'm a God? No, not yet, you're a fetus. You're still growing. Once you've lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born. So the whole universe...
it's just... an egg! I answered: now it's time for you to move on to your next life. And I sent you on your way."
Islandborn / Lola,"     The new children’s book Islandborn by Junot Díaz tells the story of a young girl, Lola, who learns from family and friends about the island where she was born. The island is not named in the book, but readers can deduce that the story is based on the history of the Dominican Republic. “Every kid in Lola’s school was from somewhere else,” the book opens. “Hers was the school of faraway places.” Lola was brought to the United States as a baby, therefore she has no memories from the island. When her teacher asks the class to draw a picture of “the country you were originally from, your first country,” Lola asks family and friends in the neighborhood what they remember most about the country where she was born. The stories paint a picture of life on the island and the forces that led her family to leave such a wonderful place. Leo Espinosa’s illustrations of people beautifully affirm a range of skin colors and Afro-Latinx identity. This diversity and genuine representation are rare in children’s books. There is so much to love about this book. The writing is lyrical with a child reader in mind. Just how hot is the island? “The heat is on you like five bullies.” How shy is Lola in class? “She hated raising her hand almost as much as she hated Nelson’s yelling.” Spanish Version Most important of all, Islandborn is the only one of dozens of new books on immigration that explains in an age-appropriate way why people are forced to leave their home countries. When Lola hears so many wonderful stories about the island, she asks the obvious question, “Then why did they come to the U.S.?”"," Finally, the building superintendent explains to her that “A monster fell upon our poor Island. . . It could destroy an entire town with a single word and made a whole family disappear simply by looking at it.” By describing the dictator Trujillo as a monster, Díaz introduces a brutal and essential political history; a history that upends the deficit narrative around immigration and highlights the push factors. He opens the door for conversation with children about the complex reasons for immigration. All too often, this essential part of the story is reserved for the author’s note on the end pages. Island born is a Harvest of Empire for young children."
The Evolution of Software Development,"     Software development has seen considerable changes since its start. Initially, programming was done in machine code, which is the lowest level of code that computers can understand. As technology improved, higher-level programming languages such as Fortran and COBOL emerged, making it simpler for programmers to create more complicated software. In the 1980s and 1990s, object-oriented programming languages like C++ and Java emerged, introducing a new way of organizing and processing data. The twenty-first century has seen the broad adoption of agile approaches, which stress flexibility and user input, as well as the general shift to cloud computing, which allows developers to design and deploy scalable and accessible apps from anywhere.Software is roughly divided into three categories: system software, application software, and embedded software. System software comprises operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, which control computers' hardware and software resources. Application software includes applications that perform specialized activities for users, such as word processors, spreadsheets, and web browsers. Washing machines, TVs, and automobile control systems are examples of physical products that use embedded software rather than traditional computers. Each kind is important in modern computing because it allows users to engage more successfully with both the digital and real environment. The software business is constantly developing, thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, blockchain, and the Internet of Things. ","machine learning are being utilized to develop software capable of predicting user behavior, automating complicated choices, and increasing operational efficiency. Blockchain technology is transforming businesses by offering a secure method for recording transactions and managing data across decentralized networks. Meanwhile, IoT devices are becoming more intelligent, with software that processes data locally on the device or leverages cloud technology to improve functionality. These developments are not only influencing the future of software development, but they also present new possibilities and challenges to developers. Software has had a huge influence on society, changing the way people interact, work, and solve issues. It has increased information accessibility, simplified complicated procedures, and created new sectors and professions. Social networking platforms, smartphone applications, and productivity tools have transformed our daily lives by introducing new opportunities to interact and communicate. Furthermore, software solutions in healthcare, such as electronic health records and diagnostic tools, have improved patient outcomes. However, the advent of software has produced concerns, such as privacy, security, and the digital divide, which remains a worry because not everyone has equal access to technology. Effective software development is essential for producing dependable and user-friendly solutions. Version control systems, coding standards, and comprehensive testing are all considered best practices."," Agile approaches like Scrum and Kanban encourage adaptability and continual improvement, allowing teams to respond to changing needs and client input more effectively. Furthermore, approaches such as DevOps encourage collaboration between development and operations teams, which speeds up product release while assuring quality and security. As software evolves, remaining current with these techniques and trends will be critical for developers and businesses seeking to remain competitive in a quickly changing market."
